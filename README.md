# CircleFile

CircleFile is a Java program that reads a file containing radius values and performs calculations on circles. It calculates the circumference and area of each circle and outputs the results to a file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Modify the `CircleFile` constructor parameters to specify the input and output file paths.
4. Run the `main` method in the `CircleFile` class.

## Input File

The input file should contain a list of radius values, with each value on a separate line. Example input file: `circleinput.txt`


Make sure the input file is located in the same directory as the `CircleFile` class.

## Output File

The program will generate an output file with the calculated results for each circle. Example output file: `circleoutput.txt`
